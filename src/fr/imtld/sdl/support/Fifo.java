/**
 * A fifo class with save capacity.
 * In the context of this Fifo, elements stored in it are called signals.
 *
 * You can queue  a signal to the fifo with the addSignal method.
 * You can know if it's empty with the isEmpty method.
 * You can take out the head signal with the get method.
 *
 * Saving a signal consists in introducing an offset at the head of the fifo,
 * so that the signal can't be removed from the fifo until the savings
 * are cancelled.
 * You can save head signals of the specified class by calling the 
 * save( aSignalClass ) method.
 * You can also save all head Integer signals having the specified int value
 * by calling save ( anInt ).
 * You can reset all savings by calling save( null ). The head of the fifo
 * returns back to its initial position, so that saved signals are again
 * accessible.
 * Signals got from the Fifo are not signal clones but original signals.
 * In a multithreaded environment, the Fifo gives no guarantees that the
 * signal is not beeing modified from an another thread.
 * None of this Fifo methods are synchronized. It's the caller's issue to
 * ensure proper synchronization.
